Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that is associated with elevated blood sugar levels in the body. It can be divided into two subtypes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes results from the body's inability to produce sufficient insulin. Type 2 diabetes results from the body's gradual resistance to insulin.</br>
